# FUCK IT I'LL USE VIM! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
## Why?
This is a super basic configuration with no plugins. I keep running into offline linux installs so this is the most basic built-in set of configurations in order to work in vim.

**VIM WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU!**

## Install
Ready for launch?
```
cp .vimrc   ~/.vimrc
```
